        <p class="overview">I am a dedicated UX/UI engineer with a passion for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. With a solid foundation in design and development, I am excited to expand my skill set by diving into Full Stack JavaScript. My goal is to blend my design expertise with robust technical skills to build comprehensive and user-friendly web applications. As a lifelong learner, I am thrilled to join this coding bootcamp and take the next step in my professional journey.</p>
       
        <h2 id="my-start">How I Got My Start</h2>
        <p>I got my start in the tech industry through a combination of education, internships, and hands-on experience. My journey began with an apprenticeship and an internship at the Apple Developer Academy and Michigan State University, where I honed my skills in iOS design and development. During this time, I published an app called 'Gone Fishin',' a poetry app, which was acknowledged by Apple and MSU. These experiences laid a strong foundation for my career, and I further expanded my knowledge by completing various programs, including the School of Operation by Rachel Allen, Next Cycle Michigan pitch training, and Tech Town MVP program.
            In addition to my formal education and training, I have worked on several exciting projects and held key roles such as teaching iOS Design and Development with Journi, keynote speaking for Google Developer Group, and serving on the board of Hendricks Foundation as a Program Manager. As the owner of Kris K Designs LLC, I have had the opportunity to service clients as a multidisciplinary creative, further enhancing my expertise in UX/UI design. Now, I am eager to build upon this foundation by learning Full Stack JavaScript at the Grand Circus bootcamp, aiming to integrate my design skills with comprehensive development knowledge.</p>
